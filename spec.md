# Spec

1. Push-based approach

- `registerIdentities` in `Semaphore.sol` calls a method in the `Bridge.sol` contract that sends over each new state root and its timestamp. The root and the timestamp get sent from `Bridge.sol` to the `OpWorldID.sol` contract on the Optimism L2 which accepts them in order to allow developers on Optimism to call `verifyProof` on WorldID actions. In order to insert a new root in `OpWorldID.sol` the `Bridge.sol` contract needs to provide a storage proof of the state of the `rootHistory` mapping in `Semaphore.sol` to certify that the newly inserted root is indeed valid. `Semaphore.sol` also needs to have an ugpradeability mechanism for `stateBridge`.

- Downsides:
  - Hard to scale, redeploying semaphore, separate impls for diff L2s

2. Pull-based approach (CRON)

- idea: proxy contract you can send state roots, checks against semaphore if they are correct and proceeds to send them to L2s. Service like Gelato periodically fetches latest state roots and checks agains semaphore before submitting to proxy

3. Pull-based approach (external service)

- idea: external service makes sure that latest root hashes are correct, and handles errors on its own. EOA, funded by us, sends txs to proxy with updated roots.
- TODO:
  - batching: multiple roots in 1 call
  - look into what changes are required on Semaphore contract in order to make opt.3. work, so if opt.1. ends up being chosen, developments don't make opt.3. infeasible

## Current issues

1. Lack of upgradeability for `Bridge.sol` and `OpWorldID.sol`.

- Add a `UUPSUpgradeable` Proxy OpenZeppelin setup for `stateBridge` in `Semaphore.sol`, and potentially add upgradeability within `Bridge.sol` itself, although it might be better to redeploy it every single time the bridge modifies `sendRootMultichain` functionality and upgrade `Semaphore.sol` instead.

2. There is no way to verify inside `OpWorldID.sol` that a newly inserted root and timestamp is valid and comes from `Semaphore.sol`.

- how to solve:
  - `onlyFromCrossDomainAccount` modifier (this is what is currently being worked on)
  - external relayer ecdsa signature on root and timestamp from Semaphore
  - use state proofs to prove validity of newly inserted roots
    - how to implement:
    - ingredients:
      - L1 blockhash
      - L1 state root
      - L1 account proof (merkle proof that proves that account 0xâ€¦ really exists on L1
      - L1 state proof -> Againt the account storage hash it will allow you to prove that a certain storage slot exists and has a claimed value
      - L1 blockheaders
    - steps:
      1. We send from L1 to L2 the L1 blockhash. You just use the opcode to get it. If you want to access the state root set for block x u need the blockhash of x
      2. On the L2 you submit a tx that contains the rlp encoded header
      3. Hash the header, compare the hash with the previously sent blockhash
      4. Revert or continue
      5. Decode the state root from the header
      6. Verify a merkle patricia proof that proves that the L1 accout exists
      7. Verify the merkle patricia proof that proves that a storage slot with a claimed value exists in the storage of this contract

## Ideas

- [Optimism L1\<\>L2 communication](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/) documentation

## Optimism L1<>L2 infrastructure

An Optimism L2 node is required to run the state bridge. The L2 node is used to fetch the latest state root from the L1 contract and submits it to the L2 contract. So if we want to send a message to the messenger on L1, that triggers a change in the canonical Optimism state that the Optimism sequencer has to include as a transaction on the L2. That state transition goes through the fault proof mechanism so that if its not included in the L2, the sequencer can be forced to include it by the fault proof mechanism (even economically punished in future iterations of the protocol). Current time to relay message (estimation for Bedrock) is around 2 minutes for a message from L1 to L2. Worst case scenario can be up to a couple of hours if sequencer is malicious and willingly doesn't want to include the transition. More info in the Optimism whitepaper.
